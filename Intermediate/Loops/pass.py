#pass is null statement that does nothing, and it is used as a placeholder as a future code
#If we want  to dont do anything in for loop then we have to use this


#but if we print like this
# for i in range(4):
#      #empty
# print("hii")
#It will give identation error , so we need pass statement which is null, doesnt do anything

for i in range(3):
    pass
print("HII, some imp work")
